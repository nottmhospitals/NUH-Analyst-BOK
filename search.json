It is a living document, designed to serve multiple purposes.\nIt is:\n\nA growing summary of our institutional knowledge, searchable and easy to use as a reference.\nAn onboarding guide, to support data analysts new to our teams or new to healthcare.\nA practical training project, allowing new users of git to practice by contributing to a project of real value.\nAn exercise in transparency, and a commitment to “being the difference we want to see” in relation to open working, and open-source analytical development.\nA searchlight, to help guide us towards other NHS organisations and contacts who may find value here, or who may be able to help us one day.\n\nBut mostly, it is a place for us to write things, so that “future us” knows where to find them. Doing this in a public github repository ensures we create something not quick and disposable, but something considered, deliberate and of gradually accumulating value.\n\nIf I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\n- Sir Isaac Newton\n\nYou can find some of our “giants” listed in the reading list and acknowledgements sections, or start exploring the table of contents to the left.",

At their best, graphics are instruments for reasoning about quantitative information. Often the most effective way to describe, explore, and summarise a set of numbers - even a very large set - is to look at pictures of those numbers. Furthermore, of all methods for analysing and communicating statistical information, well-designed data graphics are usually the simplest and at the same time the most powerful.”",

The timid and the fainthearted, and the people that expect quick results, are doomed to disappointment.”\nToyota Production System - Beyond Large-Scale Production\nby Taiichi Ohno\n“The Toyota Production System evolved out of need. Certain restrictions in the marketplace required the production of small quantities of many varieties under conditions of low demand, a fate the Japanese automobile industry had faced in the postwar period.”\n“The most important objective of the Toyota Production System has been to increase production efficiency by consistently and thoroughly eliminating waste.”\nA Study of the Toyota Production System from and Industrial Engineering Viewpoint\nby Shigeo Shingo\n“The Toyota Production System has been compared to squeezing water from a dry towel. What this means is that it is a system for thorough waste elimination. Here, waste refers to everything not serving to advance the process, everything that does not increase added value. Many people settle for eliminating the waste that everyone recognises as waste. But much remains that simply has not yet been recognised as waste or that people are willing to tolerate.”",
