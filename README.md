# NUH Analyst BOK

This repository holds the code for the Nottingham University Hospitals Analyst 
“Body of Knowledge”, an e-book written by analysts for analysts.  

The book is available here: <https://nottmhospitals.github.io/NUH-Analyst-BOK>

## It is:

* A growing summary of our institutional knowledge, searchable and easy to use 
as a reference.
* An onboarding guide, to support data analysts new to our teams or new to 
healthcare.
* A practical training project, allowing new users of git to practice by 
contributing to a project of real value.
* An exercise in transparency, and a commitment to “being the difference we 
want to see” in relation to open working, and open-source analytical 
development.
* A searchlight, to help guide us towards other NHS organisations and contacts 
who may find value here, or who may be able to help us one day.
* But mostly, it is a place for us to write things, so that “future us” knows 
where to find them. Doing this in a public github repository ensures we create 
something not quick and disposable, but something considered, deliberate and of
gradually accumulating value.

## Contributing

Contributions from inside and outside NUH are welcome, from both analysts and 
non-analysts.

The most transparent way to contribute is to open an issue with a suggestion, 
link, or resource you would like to see added to the BOK.  Pull-requests are 
very welcome, especially when worked from an issue. 
You can also email us with suggested content.

We retain editorial control, and will decide whether and how much of a given 
contribution is added to the BOK, and in what form. We envisage that most 
contributions will be valuable, and will be added to the book.
