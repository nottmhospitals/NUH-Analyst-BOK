# Conference Talks

The NHS analyst community has a strong culture of open sharing of conference materials, and 
many conference talks are published online thanks to organisations like the 
NHS-R Community.  There is so much material that it can be difficult to search 
for and find the talk you are looking for, or to discover material new to you 
from previous conferences.  

This page aims to help solve that problem, and Quarto means that this content 
is easily searchable from the search bar at the top of the page.
